📊 Project Title – Predictive Modeling with Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to solve a real-world dataset problem. The goal is to apply data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and multiple ML models to achieve accurate predictions.

The notebook walks through each step in detail, making it both a learning resource and a practical solution.
